## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Script Not Showing Up

**Problem:** You installed NovaCore but nothing happens on Miniblox.

**Solutions:**
1. **Refresh Miniblox** — Press `F5` or close and reopen the tab
2. **Check Tampermonkey is enabled** — Click the Tampermonkey icon, make sure it's enabled
3. **Verify the script installed** — Open Tampermonkey Dashboard and look for "NovaCore V3"
4. **Whitelist Miniblox** — Some browsers require explicitly allowing scripts on domains

### Menu Won't Open

**Problem:** Pressing `\` doesn't open the menu.

**Solutions:**
1. **Try a different key** — Maybe `\` is already bound to something
2. **Change the keybind** — If the menu opens even partially, use it to change the hotkey
3. **Check your keyboard layout** — Some layouts don't have `\` in the same place
4. **Restart the browser** — Close and reopen, then revisit Miniblox

### Counters Not Updating

**Problem:** Counters show but don't update their values.

**Solutions:**
1. **Make sure you're playing** — Some counters only update when you're actively clicking/playing
2. **Check browser console** — Press `F12`, go to Console tab, look for red errors
3. **Disable/Re-enable** — Open menu and toggle the counter off then on again
4. **Refresh the page** — Sometimes a hard refresh (`Ctrl+Shift+R`) helps

### Performance Issues

**Problem:** Noticing lag or slowdowns after installing NovaCore.

**Solutions:**
1. **Disable unnecessary counters** — Each active counter uses a tiny bit of CPU
2. **Check for browser extensions** — NovaCore might conflict with other userscripts
3. **Try a different theme** — Some themes are slightly heavier
4. **Close other tabs** — Free up system resources

### Can't Find Custom Colors

**Problem:** Your custom color isn't showing up.

**Solutions:**
1. **Check browser storage** — If you cleared cookies/site data, custom colors reset
2. **Re-set it** — Go to Custom Theme Color and pick your color again
3. **Check browser console** — Look for storage errors in the F12 Developer Tools
